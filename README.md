# The Pact Programming Language

[Pact](http://kadena.io/build) is an open-source, Turing-**in**complete smart contract language that has been purpose-built with blockchains first in mind. Pact focuses on facilitating transactional logic with the optimal mix of functionality in authorization, data management, and workflow.

## Pact Core and Pact

## Documentation

The [Kadena Docs](https://docs.kadena.io) site serves as the primary source of information about Kadena products.
You can find information about how to get started with the Pact language, how to execute already deployed contracts, and follow
our step-by-step tutorials. 

## Quickstart

To quickly begin exploring the Pact language, download the corresponding binary from the
latest release, see [Binary Downloads](#binary-downloads).

We recommend that new users start with our [beginner`s guide](https://docs.kadena.io/pact/beginner), which provides an 
understanding of the fundamental concepts and terminology of the language.

If you prefer a more hands-on approach, download the Pact binaries and execute the REPL.
This will allow you to begin evaluating expressions, such as `(+ 1 0)`, immediately.
